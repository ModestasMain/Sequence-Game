# Remember the Sequence - Project Instructions

## Development Workflow

### Roblox Studio MCP
- Use Roblox Studio MCP for creating objects and editing things in Roblox or for things specifically requested
- The MCP tools are available for manipulating instances, properties, and game structure directly in Roblox Studio

- If tokens usage seems that it will be too big, then ask the user for the specific navigation to reduce token usage.

### Code Editing
- **All code must be edited in the project folder** (this Visual Studio Code workspace)
- Do NOT edit code directly in Roblox Studio
- Visual Studio Code is connected to Roblox Studio through **Rojo**, which provides live synchronization
- Changes made to `.lua` files in the `src/` folder will automatically sync to Roblox Studio

## Project Structure
- `src/` - All Lua source code
- `default.project.json` - Rojo configuration file
- Code changes sync automatically when Rojo is running
